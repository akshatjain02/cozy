## What is a [dotfile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-file)?
In Unix/Linux dot-files refers to files/directories with a "." appended to their name, like ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile etc. The leading dot (.) is used as an indicator to not list these files normally but only when they are specifically requested like ls -a. This is because, generally, dot-files are used to store configurations for different applications but they are sometimes used otherwise as well.
